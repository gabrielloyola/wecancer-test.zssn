# ZSSN Backend Service ðŸ§Ÿ

This is the first Social Network maintained since the end of the times. It's about trust, engagement and everything you need to fight against the lack of resources. Be part of it: download, execute and use it as you like.

* Versions

* Configuration

1. Run `cp .env-examle .env` to create the env file based on the right configurations of the database.
2. Run `docker build` to prepare the containers.
3. Run `docker-compose up` (w/ -d option if you want to run it in background)
4. Run `docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID] bash` to access the container terminal (use `docker ps` to find the id of the container).

* Database creation

Inside the docker's terminal, run `rails db:create`. Also, you must run `rails db:migrate` to prepare the database.

* How to run the test suite

Using the container's terminal, run `bundle exec rspec`. It'll generate html page files inside 'coverage' folder generated by `simplecov`, so you can access it to see the line and branches coverage.
